This GitHub contains the Data Science and Machine Learning project named "Detecting the difficulty level of French texts" by Leo Andrade and Thomas Anthoine Milhomme. 

The aim of this project is to train a model to associate a French sentence with its level of difficulty (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2). 
This Github contains the various codes and techniques we used to obtain our best result, a video explaining our progress and a user interface for applying our model. 
The final model was created by increasing the training data and training the model with CamemBERT, a specialised model for French. 

The full explanation of how we conducted our project is contained in this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKriNFzW1CI
